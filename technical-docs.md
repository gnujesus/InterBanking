# InterBanking - Technical Specification Document

## Project Overview

InterBanking is a modern banking application built with ASP.NET Core that enables users to manage their financial accounts, perform transactions, and manage beneficiaries. The application provides a secure and efficient platform for handling various banking operations including deposits, payments, and withdrawals across different currencies.

## Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with the following layers:

1. **Domain Layer** (`InterBanking.Core.Domain`)

   - Contains core business entities and enums
   - Defines the fundamental business rules and models
   - Includes base entities and shared domain logic

2. **Application Layer** (`InterBanking.Core.Application`)

   - Implements business logic and use cases
   - Contains service interfaces and implementations
   - Handles application-specific business rules

3. **Infrastructure Layer**

   - `InterBanking.Infrastructure.Persistence`: Handles data access and database operations
   - `InterBanking.Infrastructure.Identity`: Manages authentication and authorization
   - `InterBanking.Infrastructure.Shared`: Contains shared infrastructure components

4. **Presentation Layer** (`InterBanking`)
   - Contains the API controllers and presentation logic
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses

### Key Components

#### Domain Entities

- **User**: Represents bank customers with authentication details
- **Account**: Represents bank accounts with properties for:
  - Account number
  - Balance
  - Account type (Credit/Savings)
  - Currency (DOP/USD/EUR/GBP)
  - Associated transactions
- **Transaction**: Represents financial transactions with:
  - Amount
  - Description
  - Origin and destination accounts
  - Transaction type (Deposit/Payment/Withdraw)
- **Beneficiary**: Represents saved payment recipients with:
  - Alias
  - Account number
  - Associated user

#### Enums

- `AccountTypes`: Credit, Savings
- `TransactionTypes`: Deposit, Payment, Withdraw
- `Currencies`: DOP, USD, EUR, GBP

## Technologies Used

- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8.0
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: ASP.NET Core Identity
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core
- **API**: RESTful API design
